3 things that should happen ASAP to protect the U.S. from Coronavirus:  1. Trump should reinstate the NSC anti-outbreak position he eliminated.  2. Trump should reverse plans to slash pandemic disease funding.  3. Congress should pass an emergency funding bill this month.,trump,-1
Trump proposed slashing pandemic disease funding.  He eliminated the White House position dedicated to protecting the nation from outbreaks.  He gutted and demoralized our diplomatic corps.  We could have been ready for Coronavirus.   Trump has left us vulnerable.,trump,-1
"6/ Republicans don't love Trump, but they do believe that if they don't stand up to this deep state/media cabal RIGHT NOW, then they set a precedent that will allow this same conspiracy to take down every future Republican president.",trump,-1
"3/ Many (most?) Republicans, as shown in Sen. Alexander's statement, also think Trump is reckless and dangerous.   But what you need to understand is that they think there exists a MUCH bigger threat to democracy than Trump - the deep state/media elite conspiracy.",trump,-1
"2/ Democrats, like the majority of Americans, view Trump as a threat to democracy, and this trial put on evidence of the most serious example of this threat - his use of his official powers to destroy his political rivals and cheat in an election.",trump,-1
This seems important. Guiliani essentially saying the meeting Bolton describes - and Trump denies - happened.   “I wouldn’t call it making it up.” https://t.co/6otvi2uwCr,trump,-1
"To me, the most damning evidence is this:  If Trump was really concerned about corruption, he would have referred Zelensky to the people in his Administration who work on corruption.  But he told Zelensky to call Rudy, the guy who works only on the President's reelection.",trump,-1
"Just like Trump didn't care about Burisma until Biden was running, no GOP Senator raised an issue about Biden and the entire U.S. government working to get Shokin fired when it was happening.  https://t.co/uPZzdawvEj",trump,-1
"The president's lawyers keep saying that Zelensky felt no pressure from Trump.  That's simply not true.  When Sen. Johnson and I met with Zelensky last fall, the Ukrainian president did not dispute that he was being pressured and promised not to interfere in U.S. elections. https://t.co/xfYe4N5vvo",trump,-1
"3/ Dershowitz is clearly made for TV, and I guess that’s why Trump insists that he get so much time. But every time he gets up he makes a new crazy argument. Today: anything the President does to get re-elected is by definition unimpeachable. Yikes.",trump,-1
"America has never been weaker. We have never had less influence. Not even our closest ally Britain, with a Trump soulmate in Downing Street, listens to us anymore. https://t.co/yvM1ZORtgS via @NYTimes",trump,-1
"7/ At dinner, I do a quick @MSNBC appearance and then I tell a gathering of reporters that that Senate Democrats would be 'co-conspirators' with Trump if we allowed the Senate floor to become a forum for his Biden-trashing operation. I'm hot about this, and I let it show.",trump,-1
"6/ Pam Bondi and the other Trump lawyers spend most of the day savaging the Bidens (as expected), and it become crystal clear to me: Trump is trying to use the trial to do what Ukraine wouldn't - destroy his political rivals.",trump,-1
"By saying over and over that we’ve heard limited evidence from people who spoke directly to Trump about this conspiracy, the president’s lawyers actually helped MAKE our case to hear from witnesses. https://t.co/kZDvv5QG7I",trump,-1
"6/ During Schiff's closing, he references the Trump confidante who said GOP defectors would get their heads 'on a pike'. It's the first time the GOP audibly grumbles during the entire trial. But c'mon- like it's totally implausible that one of Trump's sycophants would say that?",trump,-1
"3/ Crow introduces more information about my meeting with Zelensky in their presentation - this time it's my argument to Zelensky to stay out of American politics. Trump attacked me for this in the fall, saying that I, not him, was the one trying to corruptly influence Zelensky.",trump,-1
"6/ Man, Schiff's closing was powerful. Senators' egos don't tend to allow gushing over other politicians' performance, but as we walked out the trial tonight, Senator after Senator (albeit the Dem ones) were awestruck. Schiff is right - Trump doesn't care about us, just himself.",trump,-1
"5/ I’m thinking today, as I look across to the Republican side, how many of these Senators campaigned hard against Trump in the primary. So many of them warned how out of control he would be.  And now they are readying to green light his corruption. Corruption they saw coming.",trump,-1
"I’m not sure which is more  infuriating -   that the Trump Administration lied and claimed that there weren’t injuries in the Iran missile strike   or   that once caught, Trump called the traumatic brain injuries “headaches”",trump,-1
Democrats should stop letting Trump get away with these lies about the economy.   The truth:   Over 1 million more jobs were created during Obama’s last 3 years than Trump’s first 3. Job growth is SLOWING.  And deficits are SPIRALLING. Over $3 trillion in new debt under Trump.,trump,-1
"6/ As it gets late, both sides start to get overly chippy and personal. I’m alarmed at how often the parties are directly addressing each other. Neither the managers nor the President’s lawyers are on trial. Trump is.   Good for Roberts for stepping in gently.",trump,-1
Walking into the Senate chamber now for the trial of President Donald J. Trump.   What tremendously sad words to type.,trump,-1
RT @ThePlumLineGS: New CNN poll:  51% of Americans say Trump should be *removed.* Only 45% say he shouldn't  69% say Senate trial should fe…,trump,-1
17/ CLIMATE CHANGE: Trump reserves his greatest multilateral animus for efforts to address climate change – namely the Paris Agreement. His hostility to climate action is one of his most unforgivable legacies – and a grave threat to both our natl. security and global stability.,trump,-1
"16/ NATO: Trump has carried out a systematic campaign to weaken NATO. By doing so, he risks taking down the entire post WWII order. That would be a disaster for us, and a gift to countries like China and Russia and non-state actors like Al Qaeda and ISIS.",trump,-1
"15/ XENOPHOBISM: Trump and his nationalist compatriots weaponize immigration. When right wing groups try to copy Trump's success and deploy his playbook in countries throughout Europe, he doesn't stand up and object, he offers a wink and a nod, sometimes a warm embrace.",trump,-1
"13/ VENEZUELA: One of the few cases where Trump stood up to a dictator. Unfortunately, he played all his cards in the first few days like a nervous teenager, and now we're sanctioning the Venezuelan people and recognizing a leader who probably isn't ever going to take power.",trump,-1
"12/ LIBYA: Trump inherited a pretty miserable situation in Libya, but somehow, he managed to make it worse. Instead of doing the hard work of diplomacy to get the warring parties to the table, Trump threw his support behind General Haftar – upending years of American diplomacy.",trump,-1
"11/ LEBANON: As peaceful protests swept the Middle East this year, the Lebanese army stood apart by admirably protecting the people from attacks by Hezbollah thugs. But instead of praising the LAF for its professionalism, Trump inexplicably held up their aid.",trump,-1
"10/ SYRIA: Trump engaged in one of the most abominable acts of double cross in the history of the presidency. We asked the Kurds to fight ISIS for us, we promised to protect them, and then we stabbed them in the back by inviting the Turkish army to march in and destroy them.",trump,-1
"9/ SAUDI ARABIA: Somehow, we now take orders from the Saudis. After the Saudis killed and dismembered an American resident, our Secretary of State visited Riyadh for a smiling photo op.  Trump doesn't just refuse to stand up to them – he actively whitewashes their crimes.",trump,-1
"8/ ISRAEL: Trump has allowed Israel to take steps that make a future Palestinian state almost impossible. And he's put his son-in-law, who has no diplomatic experience, in charge of 'negotiations.'  There's no peace plan, there was never going to be a peace plan.",trump,-1
"7/ YEMEN: Under Trump, tens of thousands of innocent Yemenis have died needlessly as his admin. continued sending weapons and bombs to the Saudis.  And when Congress passed a resolution to end our involvement in this humanitarian nightmare, Trump vetoed it.",trump,-1
"6/ IRAQ: The U.S. and our partners had ISIS on the verge of defeat in Iraq, but the Soleimani strike put all this in jeopardy. The counter-ISIS campaign is on hold and our troops are being asked to leave. And now, Trump is adding fuel to the fire by threatening Iraq w/ sanctions.",trump,-1
"4/ CHINA: Trump promised to be 'tough on China' – but he's done nothing as Xi:  -conducts cultural genocide against Muslim Uighurs -gains strength in the western pacific -eats our lunch in this “trade war”, putting massive tariffs on US goods and refusing to make real concessions",trump,-1
"2/ IRAN: Trump's blind escalation has 1) led Iran to restart their nuclear program; 2) made Iran stronger in Iraq, Syria, Yemen; 3) put us on the brink of war.  And all for nothing. The Iran deal was working, but Trump ripped it all up just because it had Obama’s name on it.",trump,-1

"Today, Trump announced that if he is re-elected he will permanently defund Social Security. That may make sense to the billionaires at his country club, but it makes zero sense to me.   No, Mr. President. We will not let you destroy Social Security. We will defeat you – badly.",trump,-1

"Millions of Americans have lost their jobs and health insurance.  We should be empowering Medicare to cover all out-of-pocket health care costs.

Trump is the most corrupt president in our lifetimes and we’re witnessing more evidence today. The DOJ is not meant to be a political tool of the president.
